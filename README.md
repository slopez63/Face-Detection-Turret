# Face Detection Turret

This is a project that I am currently working on.

# Main Goals

[] Turret is able to follow a face in real time /n
[] Use an AI algorithm that can detect faces and know if they are stored in the database 
[] Create a UI that can...
  [] Turn on / off turret
  [] Add and delete saved faces
  [] Store pictures and local information of undetected faces
  [] Control movement and trigger of turret

# Hardware

- Arduino (Robotic Mechanical Manipulation)
- Rapberry Pi 4 4gb ram (Image Processing using OpenCV)
- Two servos that control yaw and pitch angles of the turret
- One simple USB camera (640 x 480 resolution)
